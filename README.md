# Principal Components Analysis of Emission Particles from Optical Remote Sensing
Main idea for the PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large number of possibly not all independent variables, while preserving as much as possible of the variation present in the data set. Specifically, variables of the original data set is orthogonal transformed into a new set of linearly uncorrelated variables, i.e. the principal components (PCs), which are constructed such that the first few PCs span most of the variation present in all of the original variables .

For PCA applying on air pollution data, research has been made to quantify the association between daily mortality (cardiovascular diseases, respiratory, pneumonia, etc) and the source-related components, for instance routinely collected concentrations of the air pollutants . In addition, study has been made to relate the principal components (PCs) with different sources of air pollution. 

We expect that the solar light intensity at 500 nm, light intensity ratio of 340 nm to 675 nm, and concentrations of the selected gas species from the measurement can be recognized and separeted by the PCA.
